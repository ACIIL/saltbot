# SaltBot
A betting bot for SaltyBet. It has two strategies choosable by the user. One of them uses a genetic algorithm to weigh data from previous matches. The other one just compares win percentages. Both select betting amounts based on confidence. Uses Chrome storage to save and load data.

- It requires about 1000 saved matches to get decent accuracy. Email me if you'd like a copy of my database.
- You can see its decision logic if you open up the JavaScript console.
